Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Video Frame Interpolation.

Stanford CS231n Final Project

Our aim is to use a Convolutional Neural Network to turn two input frames,
assumed to be sequential frames of a video, to generate a frame representing the
state of the scene in between the two input frames. We plan to use adversarial
networks to achieve good performance.
